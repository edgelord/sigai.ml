## About
UIUC Interest Group for Artificial Intelligence, including and not limited to: Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and (software side of) Robotics. We plan to gear SIGAI towards the research end of the spectrum and various applications of AI.

This is an advanced SIG: we advise those who are not comfortable with the [Recommended Backgrounds](#recommended-background) to look for alternative SIGs such as [ADSA](https://adsa-uiuc.github.io/quadday/).

We meet Mondays from 7pm - 9pm in Siebel 1111, **except for Monday, September 4th (Labor Day) and Monday, September 11th (CS After Hours).** For these first two meetings, we will meet on Thursdays at the same time and place.

Most of the meetings are coordinated over [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/623608024414854/).

## Recommended Background
- Ability to setup development environments independently
- Proficiency in Python
- Familiarity with machine learning


## First Meeting -- 8/7
- Come in with the following:
  - Research paper you recently read that was interesting
  - Research ideas/interests
  - Ideas for what to do with the SIG
