## About
We'll meet 1-2 on weekends at a room (TBD).

#### Saturday meetings

Unstructued, general discussions. Ideally a place for people to meet others with similar interests and work on projects.

#### Sunday meetings

After an introductory lecture, we'll be going through [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) over the course of the semester. In these meetings, we will address issues you may have as you go through the material or assignments.
