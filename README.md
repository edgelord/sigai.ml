- Will will be giving a presentation on his research, directed towards the RL group.

## Meeting Summaries
### First Meeting -- 9/7
- Welcome icebreaker.
- Split up into Vision/NLP/RL groups to discuss plans for the semester.
- Some people decided to work on Stanford's Computer Vision (CS231n), Berkeley's Reinforcement Learning (CS 294).

### Second Meeting -- 9/14
- Split into groups for discussion about various projects, targeting Spring 2017 Open House
