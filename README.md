## Meeting Summaries
### First Meeting -- 8/7
- Welcome icebreaker.
- Split up into Vision/NLP/RL groups to discuss plans for the semester.
- Some people decided to work on Stanford's Computer Vision (CS231n), Berkeley's Reinforcement Learning (CS 294).

### Second Meeting -- 8/14
- Split into groups for discussion about various projects, targeting Spring 2017 Open House
- RL Group went over Berkeley's CS 294 on Sunday (8/17)
- Dominic talked to the Computer Vision Group about his research

## Third Meeting -- 8/14
- Computer Vision began to learn Tensorflow, having a workshop on Thursday (8/21)
- Reinforcement Learning Group is having a PyTorch Workshop/Lecture, replacing CS 294's Tensorflow Lecture
- NLP has began to talk about what projects to potentiall work on (speech synthesis/chat bot)
